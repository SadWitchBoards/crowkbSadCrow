I haven't put in a request to get these into the QMK and VIA repos at this point.

Because of that, to get VIA working, you'll need to download the via.json and follow these instructions:

 1. in Via go the the settings tab.
 2. enable "Show Design tab"
 3. Go to the Design tab at the top (paint brush icon)
 4. Click Load by "Load Draft Definition"
 5. Locate and open the via.json
 6. You should now be able to edit the keymap.
