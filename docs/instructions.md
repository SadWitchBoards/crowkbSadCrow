**this document is in progress, just listing possible hold ups for now**

 - For the battery pads, the positive and negative pads are vias. Basically, regardless of side, the positive pad is the one closest the keys and the negative is the one closer to the outer edge.

 - For the power switch, I recommend soldering it to the underside of the pcb, to give room for the battery. It works on either side.

 - If using a bottomn plate, You should have ordered it 1.2mm thick. Use the 2mm screws through the bottom plate into the spacers and then the 3mm screws through the pcb.
